The difficulties we encountered during the initial phase of our SE project were diverse, encompassing challenges in team coordination and technical implementation. To provide a comprehensive overview, we will divide our discussion into two key aspects: The Team and the Technical Aspects.

Our very first obstacle was finding a suitable time for all team members to convene and review the assigned projects. Our disparate schedules and demanding class commitments made this task challenging. Nevertheless, we collectively agreed that in-person meetings would be more productive than online ones. After some effort, we managed to secure a group study room at the library for our meetings. To streamline our scheduling process, we decided to share regularly updated calendars with one another. Additionally, we recognized the need for structured meetings and plan to establish clear objectives and timeframes for future gatherings. We also intend to track the work distribution and review individual progress in our subsequent meetings. While we have yet to implement a Distributed Development model, we acknowledge its value and plan to adopt it for Project 2.

Turning our attention to the technical aspects, we selected the Calorie app named "Burnout" as our project. Burnout is designed to "track daily calorie intake and expenditure." Despite its meaningful purpose, we found that the project repository needed enhancement to be more appealing. Getting the application up and running posed its own set of challenges, including version mismatches and the absence of clear instructions regarding the use of MongoDB. Recognizing the need for improved documentation, we intend to address this issue in Project 2.

Furthermore, we noticed that the existing application was heavily oriented toward Windows users, which posed compatibility issues for our macOS-based team members. To address this, we plan to package the application and dockerize it, ensuring it can run seamlessly across different environments.

Another technical hurdle we encountered was the absence of a test database. Although the application had previously run successfully, we had to create a test database ourselves to verify its functionality. Additionally, we encountered deprecated methods due to changes in the Pymongo version. Notably, we identified an issue with the bycrypt.checkpw function, particularly when a user creates a new account. To rectify this, we modified the code to hash the initial password entry and compared it to the re-entered password to enhance security.

Lastly, we found that the code could benefit from improvements in readability and structure. Our goal for Project 2 is to produce cleaner code and expand Burnout's features. By addressing these challenges and making necessary enhancements, we aim to create a more effective and user-friendly application.
