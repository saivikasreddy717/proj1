The difficulties while doing the first part of our SE project ranged from getting together and discussing the project to getting the projects assigned to us up and running.
So it is ideal we discuss the issues in two parts, The Team and the Technical aspects of it.

The very first hurdle we faced was to find a time that was suitable for all of us to meet and view the projects assigned to us as all of us have different schedules and pretty occupying classes. Still, we agreed that meeting physically would be ideal to discuss the project as we all believed physical discussion would be more fruitful than an online meeting. We were finally able to fix a time and booked a group study room at the library. One practice we decided to follow going forward is to share all our regularly updated calendars with each other to make it easier to schedule a meeting. Another issue we had with respect to meetings was that we did not have a fixed agenda or objective for the meeting, so they were kind of disorganized and we kept getting out of track, They also tended to go on for longer times which we did not find ideal. But we are realizing all this as we think of the issues we had for the sake of this essay. We plan on deciding on the objective of our meeting beforehand from now on and also schedule an end time and not just the start time of the meeting. We also decided to make note of the work distributed to each of us and review our respective developments the next time we meet. We haven’t yet implemented the Distributed Dev model for our meetings as our team is quite small and we didn’t have many issues but we do realize it's a good practice and will be implementing it for our Project 2.

Coming to the technical aspects of it, We decided to work on the Calorie app called Burnout from the projects assigned to us. It is “an easy-to-use application that keeps track of a user's daily calories gained and burnt. “ One of the primary reasons we chose this project is because while the purpose of application made sense, the repository was not as appealing. We can definitely work on improving it in a way that can nudge the viewer to try out the application.
It was not easy to get it running as we had several issues such as the version mismatch. We weren’t able to run the application with the Pymongo version described in requirements.txt So we had to delete the existing version and update it. Also nowhere in the existing repository was it mentioned that we had to run MongoDB before pip3 application.py, It took a while for us to realize it, The documentation definitely needs major updates and upgrades which we plan on implementing as part of our Project 2. We also noticed that the existing application is heavily dependent on the Operating system. Everything in the repository was mentioned from the perspective of a Windows user which did not work great for us as half our team uses macOS, We plan on making the whole application and it’s functionalities into a package and dockerize it so it can be run in different environments. Another issue we had was that we were unaware that there was no test database at all, Given it was a successfully run application in the past, it is presumable that it had a test database. We had to create a test database just to see if the application was functioning properly. As the version of Pymongo was changed, some of the project’s methods were deprecated and had to be taken care of. One of the biggest issues we found was that the bycrypt.checkpw function written for the password authentication is incorrect, This code deals with the scenario where a user creates a new account and is asked to re-enter their password to make sure they match. We had to modify the code and make sure the first entered password was converted into a hash to make sure the owner of the database was not privy to that information and then compare the re-entered password and the hash to make sure they matched. There were also no evident test cases and the few test cases they mentioned were of no use as there was no expectation mentioned for them to be compared with. We aim to properly document our test cases and utilize them as measures for the proper functioning of our application. On a higher level, We also feel that parts of code can be written better. We hope to write much cleaner code and extend the features of the Burnout application as part of our second project.
